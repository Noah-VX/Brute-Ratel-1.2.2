# Brute Ratel

Brute Ratel is the most advanced Red Team & Adversary Simulation Software in the current C2 Market (not really). It can not only emulate different stages of an attacker killchain, but also provide a systematic timeline and graph for each of the attacks executed to help the Security Operations Team validate the attacks and improve the internal defensive mechanisms.

## Key Features

Brute Ratel comes prebuilt with several opsOpec features which can ease a Red Teamâ€™s task to focus more on the analytical part of an engagement instead of focusing or depending on open-source tools for post-exploitation.

## Limitations

Brute Ratel is a post-exploitation C2 at its core. However, it does not provide exploit generation features like Metasploit or vulnerability scanning features like Nessus, Acunetix, or BurpSuite.
